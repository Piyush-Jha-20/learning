**Phase 2:** Deepening Mathematical Foundations
Study Probability & Statistics (random variables, distributions, hypothesis testing).
Dive into Linear Algebra (matrices, eigenvalues, eigenvectors).
Explore Calculus & Optimization (gradient descent, convex optimization).
Implement core mathematical concepts using Python & C++.


**Phase 3:** Exploring Libraries & Data Insights
Work with financial data libraries (QuantLib, yfinance, TA-Lib, statsmodels).
Explore machine learning tools for finance (scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow).
Analyze datasets from Quandl, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance.


**Phase 4:** Building Custom Libraries & Tools
Develop custom financial libraries in Python & C++ for research.
Build backtesting frameworks for strategy evaluation.
Optimize computations with high-performance computing (CUDA, OpenMP, MPI).


**Phase 5:** Advanced Research & Algorithmic Trading
Study derivative pricing (Black-Scholes, binomial trees, Monte Carlo).
Develop quantitative trading strategies and backtest them.
Explore high-frequency trading techniques.
Implement risk management models and portfolio optimization.
